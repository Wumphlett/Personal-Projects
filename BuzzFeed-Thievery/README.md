# BuzzFeed Thievery
This operates a bot that alerts twitter users that their tweets have been included in BuzzFeed articles, without their knowledge and consent, so that they may ask BuzzFeed to remove their tweets and stop collecting ad revenue that the twitter users themselves do not recieve.  

## config.yml
To use the bot, specify the absolute path to your chromedriver, your twitter api's auth keys, and the bot's behavior on startup.
